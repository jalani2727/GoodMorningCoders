# Good Morning Coders!

Good Morning Coders brings coders of many popular programming languages together to share their coding knowledge, seek knowledge from other coders, share their projects in progress, and plan projects.

## Development Process
* **Jalani** - I saw that Ryan was interested in building something that functioned similar to StackOverflow with a dashboard component on the homepage. In the beginning stages, I authored the tables for the databse which were subject to change throughout the development process as we re-configured the functionality of the website. I also set up the route pathways which were subject to changing as we re-organized how the user-flow for the site would work. 
After establishing routes, the set up of user authentiation via passport was assigned to me as well.
Although Ryan wrote the actual code , I provided feedback on the homepage layout and suggested the organization of the homepage as it is currently.
### -Concept-
The concept of Good Morning Coders is to develop a site where computer programmers can come together to either share their knowledge of the art of coding regardless of what language it is, share their projects or project ideas, and resolve any of the common issues coders face on the daily basis.

Coding is not a skill that can be perfected. It is a skill that will continuously require you to go outside of your current knowledge to seek new techniques to solve coding-related problems whether it be done through testing or simply seeking knowledge from a fellow programmer. Good Morning Coders is a source for people to share and learn. It is also a source for people to share their ideas and even assemble a team to bring an idea to life.
